Description:  Tool for configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver
 The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA
 Linux graphics driver.  It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA
 X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This
 communication is done with the NV-CONTROL X extension.
 .
 Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature,
 and OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.
